## RR13: Local Storage

http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html

* Historically, native client applications have held an advantage over web applications
    * the OS provides an abstraction layer for storing/retrieving files

* Cookies were introduced but not all that helpful, they slow your site down but can't really hold a ton of information

*     History of local storage hacks
    * Browser wars: 
        * IE had DHTML Behaviors > a behavior called "userData" that allows web pages to store up to 64 KB of data per domain, in a hierarchical XML-based structure. 
        * no permissions dialog, and there is no allowance for increasing the amount of storage available
        * 2002, Adobe, feature in Flash 6 - “Flash cookies.” // properly known as Local Shared Objects
        * it allows Flash objects to store up to 100 KB of data per domain
        * Flash gives each domain 100 KB of storage “for free.” Beyond that, it prompts the user for each order of magnitude increase in data storage (1 Mb, 10 Mb, and so on)
        * 2007, Google launched Gears, an open source browser plugin aimed at providing additional capabilities in browsers. 
        * 2009, dojox.storage could auto-detect (and provide a unified interface on top of) Adobe Flash, Gears, Adobe AIR, and an early prototype of HTML5 storage that was only implemented in older versions of Firefox.
        * Problem: all of them are either specific to a single browser, or reliant on a third-party plugin. 
        * Goal: to provide a standardized API, implemented natively and consistently in multiple browsers, without having to rely on third-party plugins
    * “HTML5 Storage:
        * Certain browser vendors also refer to it as “Local Storage” or “DOM Storage
        * it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you.
        * Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually).
    * From your JavaScript code, you’ll access HTML5 Storage through the localStorage object on the global window object. 
                function supports_html5_storage() {
                  try {
                return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;
                  } catch (e) {
                    return false;
                      }
                    }
* based on named key/value pairs
* You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key
    * The named key is a string
    * You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. 
    * The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. 
        * data is actually stored as a string. 
        * If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.
    * 
* there is a property to get the total number of values in the storage area, and to iterate through all of the keys by index (to get the name of each key).
* 
interface Storage {
  readonly attribute unsigned long length;
  getter DOMString key(in unsigned long index);
};
* If you call key() with an index that is not between 0–(length-1), the function will return null.
Essentially. Saving information within the browser itself. 

Data is stored as strings. If you are storing something other than a string, you’ll need to coerce it yourself when you retrieve it.
